# 📊 Revenue Insights in Hospitality – Power BI Dashboard  

## 🏨 Project Overview  
Atliq Grands faced **a decline in revenue and market share** over the past few months. To help them identify the root cause and improve performance, I built a **Power BI dashboard** analyzing **three months of booking and revenue data**.  

## 🎯 Key Insights  
- **Mumbai** generated the highest revenue (~₹669M), followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.  
- **Atliq Exotica** was the top-performing property, with ₹320M in revenue, 57% occupancy, and a **24.4% cancellation rate**.  
- **MakeMyTrip & LogTrip** contributed the most bookings.  
- **Elite room types** had the highest cancellation rates, leading to a revenue loss of ₹298M.  

## 🚀 Impact & Recommendations  
✔ **Dynamic pricing models** to maximize revenue.  
✔ **Improved customer experience** to boost occupancy and retention.  
✔ **Enhanced partnerships** with OTAs for greater visibility.  
✔ **Cancellation trend analysis** to reduce revenue loss.
